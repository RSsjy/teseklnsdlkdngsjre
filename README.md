This code will not work without sections that are not in github, i am not trying to build a project, this is just an attempt at trying to get chatGPT to create an app without me modifying the code at all. Unless you really want to please don't waste your time and try to figure out what anything does. I don't even know what anything does, I am just looking at the UI that is displayed from only chatGPT's code.
